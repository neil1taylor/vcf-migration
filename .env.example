# VCF Migration Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and configure as needed

# =============================================================================
# PRICING OPTIONS (Choose one)
# =============================================================================

# Option 1: Cloud Functions Proxy (RECOMMENDED)
# Deploy the pricing proxy to IBM Cloud Functions and set the URL here.
# This keeps your API key secure on the server side.
# See: functions/pricing-proxy/README.md for deployment instructions
VITE_PRICING_PROXY_URL=https://us-south.functions.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1/web/your-namespace/default/vcf-pricing-proxy

# Option 2: Direct API Key (NOT RECOMMENDED for production)
# If you don't want to use the proxy, you can set the API key directly.
# WARNING: This exposes your API key in the browser!
# Get your API key from: https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys
# VITE_IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# =============================================================================
# NOTES
# =============================================================================
# - If neither is set, the app will use static fallback pricing data
# - The proxy is preferred because it:
#   1. Keeps credentials server-side (secure)
#   2. Caches responses to reduce API calls
#   3. Handles CORS issues automatically
#   4. Falls back gracefully if API is unavailable
